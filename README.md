# storf-reporter-enhancement
StORF-Reporter is a genome annotation tool that identifies stop-open reading frames (StORFs) in unannotated bacterial regions. Using a modular Python pipeline with BLAST and CD-HIT, it uncovers potential genes overlooked by traditional annotation tools, enabling deeper biological insights.
